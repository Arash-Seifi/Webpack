# Webpack

First we start by making our "package.json" file: 
```
npm init -y
```
Now we install our packages(webpack and webpack-cli):
```
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```
NOTE: if you see "npm i -D webpack webpack-cli" , it is the same but with their shortcuts

Now in your root make an "index.html" file ,a src folder and a "index.js" inside your src folder ,and a "webpack.config.js" file

### Your Webpack.config.js

You can think of environments as the context in which your code is running. During development, you're building and running the application on your local machine. Going to production is the process of making your application ready to be deployed and consumed by users.so it means that the files that you work in development must not always be used in production , so webpack makes a "dist" folder that contains the code for out production

## In package.json 
make a new script: 
```
"scripts" : {
     "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
}
```
The first command uses webpack and then we tell the webpack to, use the following file as its config

## now if we run the command :
```
npm run build
```
we see that a new folder has been added to our root(dist),and inside that, there is a bundle file that we can Link in our "index.html" file
