# Chache Busting
The code here is the Combination of the Config and Bootstrap_Tailwind

So we're using webpack to bundle our modular application which yields a deployable /dist directory. Once the contents of /dist have been deployed to a server, clients (typically browsers) will hit that server to grab the site and its assets. The last step can be time consuming, which is why browsers use a technique called caching. This allows sites to load faster with less unnecessary network traffic. However, it can also cause headaches when you need new code to be picked up.


### Our new webpack.config :

what this does is : it makes and puts a random value(Hash) inside our file name , so that everytime it is build it will have a random value. So how do we link this always random file name to our pages.Here we use HtmlwebpackPlugin.

```
npm i -D html-webpack-plugin
```
After installing , we have to tell webpack to use this plugin , so :

### Ourwebpack.config : 

```
const htmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
```
See the image above to Know how to use it.

### Making a Template File :
if you now look at your dist folder(``` npm run build ``` first), You will see that you have a new html file, that has the correct links But without Our content, Here we make a tamplate.html file and use it as a template for our plugin.

Now in here put all of your Content(What was in index.html before)

### Tell webpack to use the template :
in our config :
```
new htmlWebpackPlugin({
    template : "./src/template.html"
  })],
```
